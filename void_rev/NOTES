=== Outpost Supply And Demand ===

Stage 1: 
Have  fcurrentbuyrate decrease a little for each purchase, meaning that if someone sells to you over and over, they make diminishing returns.
Have fcurrentsellrate increase a little for each sale, meaning that if someone buys from you over and over, they make diminishing returns.

Have these values pro-rated over a week, so that if one week or more passes, they return to fbuyrate and fsellrate. 

Do the pro-rate calculation when someone ports. Just take number of hours since last port divided by number of hours in a week, and multiply that by 
the difference between fucrrentbuyrate and fbuyrate. Same type of thing for fcurrentsellrate.





Alliance owned ships:
The criteria for claiming is either the ship has no missiles and 10% shields or less, OR it is owned by the same alliance as you and unoccupied.
So to borrow an alliance ship, you claim it then beam to it.



==== SPACE BANNERS ====
You can buy space banners and place them in sectors
that are not owned by an alliance (other than your own).
They can say up to 80 characters.
They remain for 1 earth month until they sputter out. 
They are relatively cheap. 
Each sector can have up to 12 banners


==== RANK ====
Rank points determine rank (Cadet, Captain, Admiral...)

You get rank points the following ways:
1) Discovering new sectors
2) Discovering new planets
3) Destroying things that don't belong to you or your alliance
4) Claiming territory
5) Alliance questing



==== ALLIANCE QUESTING ====

These should build your appreciation within an alliance,
as well as have possible monetary rewards.

Question should also raise your rank. 

Ideas:

Find the super secret guy and give him this and he'll give you some cool thing, bring it back here"
and then you have to ask around about the guy

Or maybe
"Go put a tracking beacon on such and such"
Durandal79: or theres a prison world in a one deep somewhere that you have to defeat senteries and resuce someone

it may have to be that as soon as you do it, it gets back to how it was before so that someone else could do the same mission
otherwise you have to have an infinite number of missions somehow
Durandal79: yeah or the warp point closes to you have youve left that sector 
Durandal79: OR make several super quests that can ONLY be done by one person so then people are competeing to complete them


==== APPRECATION ====
Need a table to keep alliance "Appreciation" of players.

IN REGARDS TO MOB-RUN ALLIANCES:
In this way, players can garner the favor of alliances,
including possible use of their facilities, planets,
etc. Once you get enough appreciation to join an alliance,
you they will offer to let you join.
You will have to go and see the representative for your
alliance, which, for the mobs, may be stardock, or 
some other hidden location.
They may ask for specific tasks to be done, and rewards given for these
tasks. Destroying opposing alliance facilities would 
increase the alliance's appreciation of you.
Also, doing bad stuff to an alliance will decrease that
alliances appreciation of you. If you go negative, they
will hate you. Joining an alliance that is hated 
by another alliance will
automatically decrease their appreciation of you significantly.
They may attempt to board your ship and steal it, or if hateful enough attack you on sight, or just block your passage, etc.

Thus we need a table for player appreciation and other alliance
appreciation. 

And an act from a member of an alliance counts negative
towards your personal appreciation as well as the alliances
appreciation. So if you represent Team A and you attack Team B, your appreciation from Team B's point of view goes down,
and their appreciation of Team A goes down, and if Team A hates Team B, then their appreciation of you goes up!

And if you turn against your Team, they will quickly lose appreciation for you, revoking priveleges
and ultimately disbanding you. Then they will likely try to destroy you.

*NOTE* Players could join a team, then, knowing the location of it's facilities, destroy it and gain
a lot of appreciation from opposing teams.

IN REGARDS TO PLAYER-RUN ALLIANCES:

The Alliance Leader will have to manually manage its relation with players.
Appreciation is either not calculated or not used in this instance. 
They will have to make offers to players themselves, and allow them
facility use manually, etc. 



==== TERRITORIES ====

People in alliances can claim territory for their alliance.
If a sector is unclaimed, any alliance can claim it.
If a sector is claimed, it can be claimed by another alliance
by being the sole force in the sector. In other words, if you
deploy Sentinels into the sector, and there are no other
sentinels, or armed ships, or armed planets etc in
the sector, then you can claim it. In this way,
alliances can only keep space that they plan
on defending. 

It costs 1000 credits to register a sector as claimed!!

The advantage of owning territory is that anyone
in the owning alliance can safely display the sector from anywhere
and even Warp to it with a warp drive.
(Other sectors cannot be displayed unless
you are in them, and warping can result in ship destruction
or misplacement).
You also tend to get better deals from spaceports 
when your alliance owns the territory they are in.

*MOBS that belong to alliance will claim whatever sectors
they can afford to, unless they are owned by alliances
that their alliance appreciates. Many mobs also
ignore sectors for which they have neutral appreciation
of the owners. Mobs are HIGHLY likely to claim one-deep and almost
always claim two-deep sectors if they can.
Unaligned mobs ignore territories. 


==== PLAYER ALLIANCES ====
It costs 250,000 credits to start a registered alliance.
Alliances allow the sharing of facilities
	-Ships
	-Planets
	-Credits.

They also allow you to claim territory. 

You can invite non-aligned mobs to join your alliance.


==== MOBS ====

==Mob Behavior==
Mobs should have a stack of chores they want to do.
They should do the top chore, but if something piques
their interest it should get pushed, complete it, pop it,
and then do the next thing in the stack (which is what
they were doing before they got distracted). 
For example:
	Mob's chore is to go get colonists for his planet.

	push(COLONIZE);

	however when he pops colonize, he sees that he cannot
	because he doesnt know where to find colonists. So he pushes
	COLONIZE back onto the stack, followed by
	push(FIND_COLONISTS);
	
	He then sees this command, and starts cruising around randomly
	trying to find a planet with colonists. When he finds them,
	he memorizes the location,
	he pops the next command, which is COLONIZE. Now he knows
	of a planet with colonists and can finish the COLONIZE task.


	If, while running a chore, they encounter stimuli, they can
	push a new chore. For example, while trying to find a planet
	with colonists, they run into an enemy, they can push DESTROY_ENEMY



==Mobs & Alliances==
The mob alliances, being pre-made, should
start with 10 or so members. (Maybe
gaussian around a mean of 10 or 15)
But the leader should, when running into
likeable or neutral mobs that are unaligned,
send them invites to join.
Leaders should decide whether to invite based on these criteria:
	- Number of members. Those with low members should recruit.
	  If you are below the set threshold (10?) then you should
	  almost definitely recruit. If not, you probably shouldn't
	  unless you appreciate the person enough. 
	- Unaligned. They can only ask unaligned people/mobs.
	- Appreciation. This highly affects the invite. Those
	  with high appreciation should be invited. Those with negative
	  appreciation should not be considered. 

	IN SUMMARY - ASSIGN POINTS TO CURRENT MEMBER NUMBER TO
	COMPARE WITH APPRECIATION. 


== Mob Leader Behavior ==
Mob leaders priority should be to obtain a home base,
obtain credits, obtain ships, and obtain members.
If all those are satisfied, then 
This way if they 


=Mob Alliances Also  have an ambassador with invitation powers located
at some fixed spot such as stardock or the evil stardock.

Mobs can then decide whether to join or not
based on these criteria:
	- Impulse; a touch of random chance
	- Attitude; mobs should have attitudes to help them make
	  decisions. They can be nice, cruel, lone rangers, etc

SHOULD A MOB OR PLAYER REJECT AN INVITATION, THE LEADER SHOULD NOT ASK AGAIN FOR ONE EARTH MONTH

=Mob Behavior in an Alliance
	Mobs in an alliance should try to improve their alliance's wealth first, and then their own. (Much like bugbots and mainbrains in fact).
	Priorities
	1) Cultivate and colonize alliance-owned planets.
	2) Claim sectors
	3) Explore
	4) Standard Mob Priorities














== SCHEMA NOTES ==

Player table needs to hold both players and mobs. BMOB
Alliance needs  a Leader foreign key.
