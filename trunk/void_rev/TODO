5) System Message queue (date, binactive, toplayer). In this way, messages will be queued up and delivered to the player
	when they are online. In the server thread, before blocking on receive, they should check for and display active messages
	to the player in the queue, and in the DB should be then marked inactive.The inactive messages could be deleted
	periodically (perhaps nightly via cron job)
	This would also function to tell players if something happened, like they got blown up while away..
